# SprinterDFL
SprinterDFL is an experimental astronomy project developed by Liam Davies.

Instead of using high-end fixed focal length ('prime') telescope optics to take photos of space, the SprinterDFL project aims to use zoomable camera lenses to create automated dynamic focal length (DFL) timelapses of deep-sky space objects.

Combining a superzoom lens with a cooled DSO astronomy camera allows the user to capture incredibly deep images of space at any focal length. This project aims to fully automate this process and provide the tools, scripts and electronics design to streamline the image processing.
